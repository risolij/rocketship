* Let's build a simple application
The goal of this project is to practice rust by attempting to build a simple application.

What shall we build?
#+begin_src rust
println!("I don't know, but let's start!");
#+end_src

* Flakes
** init
   Initialize the flake in the =git= repo which will build the =flake.nix=
   #+begin_src sh
     nix flake init
   #+end_src
** edit your =flake.nix=
   create your custom build inputs && outputs

** nix develop
   use =nix develop= to build the flake.lock file && create the dev environment.
   #+begin_src sh
     nix develop
   #+end_src
