  Let's attempt to build a dashboard using the /Rocket/ framework that does something fun.  This project is for learning purposes only, and is not something that should be mimic'd as I'm sure most things are wrong :-D.
** Potential Idea
   Dashboard based around earthquakes 
     - where they happen
     - average magnitude
     - something else?
  
** Some tools involved
