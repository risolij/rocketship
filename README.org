* rocketship
  Let's attempt to build a dashboard using the /Rocket/ framework that does something fun.  This project is for learning purposes only, and is not something that should be mimic'd as I'm sure most things are wrong :-D.
** Potential Idea
   Dashboard based around earthquakes 
     - where they happen
     - average magnitude
     - something else?
  

* Todo [0%]
- [ ] Implement html form to allow custom query timeframes
- [ ] Generate graph using =plotly.rs= on page load
- [-] Setup postgres
  - [X] configure =flake.nix= to allow postgres to be run
  - [ ] configure database on container which custom user
  - [ ] setup db connection in rocket
- [ ] Sort data by date and/or by magnitude
- [ ] figure out how to implement [[https://yew.rs][yew]] for frontend work? Rather than templating systems
